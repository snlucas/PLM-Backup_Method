# PLM-Backup_Method
A Backup method for Siemens Plant Simulation.

## It isn't finished
The project isn't finished and I cannot finish it because i no longer work with Plant Simulation, and don't have a license.
So, if you like the project idea, *feel free to use*, and **please, contribute. I will apreciate that.**

# About the Project
Create a backup of your project in Plant Simulation is a very important task, and it can rid you a lot of headaches.
It doesn't mean you'll remember to do that everytime. So, this method is a easy way to automatyze this.
You just need to save this model as obj and load it in your project.

**(Important!)** Move your frames into the backup method frame, and start EventController from the Backup Method frame.
